Gameplay Ideas:

    COMBAT:
        when attacking, choose from certain body parts at random to attack.
        Each body part has a different debuff that can be applied to the enemy when damaged\destroyed.
            The debuff gets stronger the more damage the body part takes.

            Players are attacked in the same way, and their body parts can be damaged\destroyed.
                The body parts can heal over time or with the use of items.
                But body parts can be permanently destroyed if they take too much damage.
                    The player can still play, but they will be at a disadvantage.
                    They can replace the body part with a prosthetic.
                        Prosthetics come in different rarities and have different stats.
